Swords and Wizardry Core 4th printing random character generator. 
======================

A simple random character generator for swords and wizardry written in ruby. Currently it just generates six random ability scores and identifies the highest, as well as outputting the fields from the ability score tables. Please change the first line to the location of your ruby environment, or remove it if you intend to run the program with ruby directly, e.g., "ruby SW-Tools-Character_Generator.rb". 

The following is still on the ToDo list.

=========================================

--Find a more elegant way to implement the ability score tables.

--Add code to give the character a class based on the top two ability scores.

--Add a way to randomly assign the core races from the rulebook (with a preference for humans).

--Add a simple way to generate a class appropriate equipment list.

--Output a usable text character sheet.

--Find a way to output a fancy LaTeX formatted character sheet.
